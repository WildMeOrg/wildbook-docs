# Site admin

Under Silo Security, users are grouped under organizations, which typically align with real-world organizations. To ensure that organizational goals are met, Wild Me established the **Org-Admin Role**. These are platform members who will handle user management and address bulk import concerns for their organization.

## How to apply for the Org-Admin Role

To get the Org-Admin Role, contact either a *site admin or Wild Me*. You can manage the following aspects of a platform by using the top navigation and selecting **Administer**.

## Logs

* **User access logs** provide session information that indicates a user's IP address and sign-in time.
* **Encounter submissions log** provides Encounter creation information that indicates the time when Encounters are created to provide a reference to the encounter.
* **Deleted encounters log** provides a record of Encounters that were deleted and a reference to restore the Encounter using the Library Management functionality.
* Email log provides a record of the automated emails sent from the platform including the type of email, who it was sent to, and what time it was sent.
