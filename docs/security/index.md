Wildbook provides flexibility in securing **data ownership** and **visibility**. For example, a Wildbook could be completely secured to only ever be accessible to a user who has logged in, blocking any public visibility of data. In another configuration, Wildbook can be a very visible repository of global data (see [Sharkbook](https://www.sharkbook.ai)) but only allow for data curation by pre-approved users. 

### Silo Security Model

[Silo Security](silo-security/index.md) provides a secure sandbox for individual users to enter and curate their data. 

* Your user data is visible only to you.
* You can share data specific users in Wildbook via [Collaborations](../security/silo-security/index.md#Collaborations), which must be reciprocally approved at the "view-only" and "edit" level.
* Users can match individual animals from your catalog but must have an edit Collaboration with you to set the match ID and affect your catalog.
* Users attempting to view your data will be blocked from seeing your Encounters and Marked Individuals and be prompted to send you a Collaboration request. 

Examples of Silo Security-based Wildbooks include:

* [Flukebook](https://www.flukebook.org)
* [African Carnivore Wildbook](https://africancarnivore.wildbook.org)
