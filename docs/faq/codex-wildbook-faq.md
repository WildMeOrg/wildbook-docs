# Codex to Wildbook FAQ

## What's the difference between an Encounter and a Sighting?

[Sightings](../introduction/sighting.md) in Wildbook are the same as in Codex - a group of animals at a related time and place. An animal from the Codex Animal tab is the same as a Wildbook [Encounter](../introduction/encounter.md) page.
