System administrators are Linux and computer hardware-savvy individuals who set up Scout inside a lab. Their primary responsibility is installing Linux on a computer that passes all the system requirements, connecting a network-attached storage(NAS) device to the laptop to hold high volumes of imagery, and installing and running Scout via Docker. A system administrator verifies proper Scout installation and then communicates the URL to one or more lab leads.
