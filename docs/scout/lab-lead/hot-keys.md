# Hot Keys

Lab Leads should set up hot keys and labels before assigning tasks to annotators.

## Assign hot keys to labels

Hot keys are used to easily jump from one label to another. Here are the steps to follow when assigning hot keys:

1. On the Scout homepage, click **Labels**.
2. On the Label manager window, users will see the list of labels to which users can assign hotkeys. *Note: If a label needed is unavailable, users can add their own.*
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Select the preferred hot key from the dropdown list.
5. Click **Save** to save all the changes.
    *Note: Labels without assigned hot keys will not show up in the* **Shortcut Keys** *box during an annotation or ground truth task.*

## Add a label

Adding new labels (classifications) is useful for future model retraining but does not add classifications to the current Scout version. Here are the steps to follow when adding a label:

1. On the Scout homepage, click the **Labels** button.
2. On the Label manager window, click the **+ADD NEW LABELS** button.
3. Enter the label on the space provided, and use the dropdown list to assign a hot key.
    *Note: Labels without assigned hotkeys will not show up in the* **Shortcut Keys** *box during an annotation or ground truth task.*
4. Click **Save** to save all the changes.

It is recommended that you create an "Unknown" label for any annotations that cannot be classified on sight for future model training precision.
