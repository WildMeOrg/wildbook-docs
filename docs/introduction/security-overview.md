# Security Overview

Wildbook provides flexibility in **securing data ownership** and **visibility**. For example, a Wildbook could be completely secured to only ever be accessible to a user who has logged in, blocking any public visibility of data. In another configuration, Wildbook can be a very visible repository of global data (see [Sharkbook](https://www.sharkbook.ai/)) but only allow for data curation by pre-approved users.
