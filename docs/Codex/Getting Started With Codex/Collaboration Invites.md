# Extend Collaboration Invites - Codex

## Collaborations Table

The **Collaborations** section at the bottom of your profile page displays the following information about users you have collaborated with in a table:

* Under the **Name** heading is either the **Full name** or **Email address** associated with the collaborator’s account.
* Under the **View** heading, it states the level of access to a collaborator’s data you have, as either no access, pending, or full view access. With full-view access, you and your collaborator can see each other’s Sightings data.
* Under the **Edit** heading, it states whether you have no, pending, or full edit access. If you have full edit access, you can edit data for all Sightings belonging to a collaborator, and they can edit yours.

## Add Collaboration

To create a new collaboration:

1. Click the **ADD COLLABORATION** button.
2. Search for a user by entering either their username or email address in the search field, then click the **SEARCH** button.
3. In the results box, select the row of the user you wish to create a collaboration with, then click the **ADD** button.

This sends a collaboration invitation to that user, which they can approve or deny.

## Edit Collaboration

Edit the current state of a collaboration by clicking on the **Edit** pencil icon button under the **Actions** heading. Select **View**, **Export**, or **Edit** access. To delete a collaboration, select **Revoke Collaboration**.
