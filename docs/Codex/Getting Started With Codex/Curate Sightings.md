# Sighting Curation - Codex

## Pending Sightings

Check information about *Pending Sightings* either on your *Codex profile page*, where you can view your own pending sightings, or from the *Public queue*, where you can reach other users’ pending sightings.

## Assigning Annotations

1. On a *Pending Sightings page*, assign annotations by clicking the **ANNOTATE PHOTOGRAPHS** button on the *Overview* section of the page.
2. You will be directed to the **ANIMALS** section of the page.
3. Click the **+** button next to the photo of the Animal you want to add annotations with.

## Sightings

* A Sighting is a time and place where one or more animals are documented.
* If the sighting contains only one animal, then only annotations under *Animal 1* are required.
* If the sighting contains multiple animals, click the **ADD ANIMAL** button to annotate a different individual.
* This will create a new section named **Animal X**. \*X is the number in which order you added the Animal.

## Create a Sighting

* After you’re done annotating a pop-up window with a *Ready to commit* message will appear.
* Click the **COMMIT** button to submit your Sighting report.
