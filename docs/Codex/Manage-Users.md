## Create Collaborations

Collaborations provide you with access to either **View** or **Edit** another user's data.

Under the **Create Collaborations** section, you can select two users from the drop-down menus. Click the green **CREATE COLLABORATION** button to form a collaboration with the selected users.

***

## Collaborations

The collaborations table displays all the existing collaborations.
To edit an existing collaboration, Click the **Pencil icon** under **Actions** on the collaborations table. From here, you can change the user's current access state to:

* **View**: you can access the sightings the other user owns.
* **Export**: you can export the data the other user owns, for use in research external to the platform.
* **Edit**: you can make changes to the user's data in-platform.

Note that these are hierarchical; if you have one level of collaboration, you have the lower ones as well.

To revoke an existing collaboration, click the **Prohibitory symbol** under **Actions** on the collaborations table. This will delete the collaboration.
