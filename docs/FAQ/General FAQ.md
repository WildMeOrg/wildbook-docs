## How do I delete an encounter?

Click the Edit button on the [Metadata](https://docs.wildme.org/product-docs/en/wildbook/introduction/encounter/#metadata) window of an Encounter. Then click **Delete Encounter?**

Additional help with managing [Metadata](https://docs.wildme.org/product-docs/en/wildbook/introduction/encounter/#metadata) in Wildbook is available in our docs.

## Someone is leaving the platform. Should I delete their account?

Once an account has data associated with it, you should never delete the account. To disable an account in Wildbook, remove the roles and permissions, turn off email notifications, and change the password. This will ensure that data integrity is maintained while removing the user's access, and will keep the account available should it need to be restored at any point.

## A colleague is leaving and we need to access to their data when they're gone.

This is a great time to establish an edit [Collaboration](https://docs.wildme.org/product-docs/en/wildbook/security/silo-security/#collaborations) with the departing user so that you can manage their Encounters even when they leave your organization.

If your colleague has already left or has chosen not to accept your Collaboration request, you may consider setting up a new Wildbook account with an email address that goes to a shared inbox. If you and select colleagues want to collectively manage this data, then using a shared inbox means any one of you can reset the password if someone leaves and still maintain access to the account.

Wild Me staff will not mediate any issues that arise between users over account ownership.

## I told the browser to not show me confirmation dialogues. How do I get them back?

## Why am I seeing an error message when I upload my images?

Images that have been transferred across communication tools (Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.) undergo processing that causes them to fail. We recommend transferring images using a dedicated file-sharing system (Dropbox, etc.) or you can ZIP the images before sharing them through communication tools. These methods preserve the AIQ (Apparent Image Quality) needed for pixel-level zooming in that may be required to find your animals.

## How can I verify that all of my images were uploaded?

Create a task with all of your images and then export them using the following steps:

1. Create a task that contains all of the images you've uploaded
2. Filter the task list to to your newly created task
3. Select the Image export option
4. Review your export

## I need to use custom labels that aren't in my model. What should I call them?

When leveraging custom classification labels for data that will be used for new model training, consider matching the classification labels to the [taxonomy mapping from lila.science](https://lila.science/taxonomy-mapping-for-camera-trap-data-sets/). This allows for greater consistency in machine learning in the conservation space.

## I tried to reset my password but I didn't receive an email.

Check your spam or trash folder for the password reset email. If it's not there, let us know in the [Community Forum](https://community.wildme.org/).

## A colleague is leaving and we need to access to their data when they're gone.

This is a great time to establish an edit [Collaboration](https://docs.wildme.org/product-docs/en/codex/security/collaborations/) with the departing user so that you can manage their Sightings even when they leave your organization.

If your colleague has already left or has chosen not to accept your Collaboration request, you may consider setting up a new Codex account with an email address that goes to a shared inbox. If you and select colleagues want to collectively manage this data, then using a shared inbox means any one of you can reset the password if someone leaves and still maintain access to the account.
