# System Maintenance

## Add Survey Images

If **Scout** is running, it automatically checks this folder periodically for new images and copies them for internal storage and processing. Images added to this folder disappear from the Ubuntu desktop folder as **Scout** imports them.
 
Note: Anyone who has access to the **Scout** Server or the NAS remotely can copy aerial survey images into the /nas/images folder.
 
An alert bar displays in **Scout** when image ingestion is in progress, warning users that new images are being added and therefore not all images may be available for task creation.

## NAS Disconnection and Reconnection

The following process is useful if you need to disconnect and reconnect the NAS while Scout is running and are unable to start or restart Scout.

1. Delete the file `data/scout/tmp/config/settings.json` from the Ubuntu Terminal
    * Using the terminal, the command would be `rm data/scout/tmp/config/settings.json`
    * Using the Files utility, go to the home directory and look for the folder `tmp/config`, then manually delete the `settings.json` file.
2. Restart Scout
