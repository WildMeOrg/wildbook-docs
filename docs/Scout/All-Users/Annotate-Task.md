# Annotating Your Assigned Tasks

If an unfinished task is assigned to you directly, you can click the **Annotate button** next to the task on the **Tasks table** to begin annotating randomly presented images. The annotation screen allows you to *click-drag* to create a bounding box. Use the down arrow key or begin typing to select the correct label for the annotation. In addition to the *click-drag* motion for creating annotations, the following tools are available to you in the annotation interface:

## Annotation Toggle

When annotating or ground truthing a task, annotation labels can be applied to specific regions or objects in an image as tags or markers.

Toggle the visibility of the annotation labels and label delete buttons by clicking the **Show Labels** checkbox in the bottom left corner:

* Toggle the checkbox on to view the annotation labels and trash can icons to delete annotation labels. This is the default state.
* Toggle the checkbox off to hide the annotation labels and delete buttons, so the image and annotations are fully visible.
