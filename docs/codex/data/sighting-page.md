# Sighting page

A Sighting page provides information regarding a [sighting](https://docs.wildme.org/product-docs/en/codex/getting-started-with-codex/#sighting), to include the photographs and annotations, time and date, and queue status. Sightings can contain Animals or Individuals.

## Header

The header content is visible as long as you are on the sighting page. This includes:

* Featured Photo: the image that displays as a thumbnail of this sighting.
* Submitter name: A link to profile of the user who submitted the sighting. Use this to determine if a fellow researcher is a good candidate for collaboration.
* Sighting status: The processing status of the sighting. This is intended to allow users to know if all expected matches have been found. Status options include Unreviewed, In progress, Reviewed, and Unidentifiable.
* 3-dot menu: Located in the upper right corner of the header. Provides two options:
    * Re-run identification: Send the sighting through the identification pipeline again. Sightings are typically re-run with new parameters or after annotations and animals have been adjusted.
    * Delete sighting: Delete the entire sighting, including images and annotations, from the system. If sighting is associated with an individual and that individual has other sightings, the individual will remain.

If you have more than one image of a Sighting, you can change the Featured Photo.

1. Hover over the current Featured Photo and click the Change Photo overlay to open a modal.
2. Select the image you want to be featured and click Save.

### Identification Pipeline Status

Processing a sighting requires both computational and human intervention. The pipeline displays the current status of the sighting's processing and indicates if a user is needed for the current step.

* Sighting Submission: The sighting was uploaded to the Codex. No user involvement is needed.
* Sighting Preparation: The sighting is added to the job queue. Also records the number of photographs in the sighting. No user involvement is needed.
* Animal Detection: Annotations are found within the images uploaded, or that detection was skipped. No user involvement is needed.
* Sighting Curation: Annotations are available to be assigned to animals. This stage requires human review and confirmation. Access the curation by clicking Assign Annotations. Note: if detection was skipped, instead click Annotate Photographs to draw the annotations manually.
* Identification: The sighting's annotations have been compared to the database and potential matches are available. This stage requires human review and confirmation. Access the match results by clicking View Match Results.

## Annotations tab

The annotations tab shows all of the photographs and annotations associated with the sighting. If multiple annotations are on a single image, the image will be displayed multiple times.

* Show annotations: A toggle the shows and hides the annotations of an image. Annotations are shown by default.
