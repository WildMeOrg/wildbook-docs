# Photography Guidelines

When reporting a Sighting, photographs can be submitted to Codex to identify Individuals. Here are the guidelines for a greater chance of successful identification:

* The **Individual** in the photo is distinguishable (i.e. is free-standing or clearly in the foreground).
* The **Individual** occupies the majority of the frame.
* The **Individual** is located near the center of the photograph.
* The **Individual** is in focus and has good image resolution.

Here are what you need to **AVOID** for a successful identification:

* The **Individual** is part of an overlapping herd or group of animals.
* The **Individual** is obstructed by more than 25% by other animals or objects.
* The **Individual** is relatively small.
* The **Individual** is blurry and out of focus due to being too far from or too close to the camera.
* The **Individual** is located around the edges of the image.
* Part of the **Individual** is outside the edge of the frame.

Codex caters to multiple species. For best results, visit their [Codex platform](https://www.wildme.org/platforms.html) and navigate to **Learn > How to Photograph** on the menu bar.

## **Image Formats and Sizes**

* Codex accepts photographs in a variety of formats, including **.jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .bmp**. *(Note:* **.tiff** *format is not supported)*
* Use photographs between **480px** and **1600px**.
* When running detection and identification, photographs smaller than **480px** are sized up which may cause blurriness. Photographs bigger than **1600px** put a strain on the server and cause identification to take longer.
* A compression ratio of **90%** is sufficient. Uploading photographs with a higher compression ratio will not influence the identification process.
