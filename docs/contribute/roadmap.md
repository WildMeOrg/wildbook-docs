# Roadmap
The roadmaps below are rough outlines of our objectives. We operate by milestones, and sometimes things change dramatically because of technical limitations or pressing issues reported by users.

## Wildbook
We are working on a improve-and-refresh objective. We want to improve on the user experience of Wildbook users with each release while also making the technology more accessible to the development community and independent installers. As such, we trade off a major feature release with a timeboxed tech debt release.

### 10.9.0
 - Updating the Encounter details page with a new design.  
 - Laying the groundwork for using a vector database for matching. 

### 10.10.0
 - Updating the Matching page with a new design. 
 - Additional API endpoints, including extensions for data export. 
 - Improving the observability of the platform to increase stability and improve support.

### 10.11.0
 - Updating the Individual and Sighting details pages with new designs.
 - Demonstrations of using the new import and export API endpoints.
 - Matching performance improvements and Miew-id visualizations 

### And Beyond
This work is planned for development, but is not set for an immediate release. Note that this list does not include minor changes and updates, some of which may be done iteratively. Are you interested in working on something here? [Reach out!](https://discord.gg/zw4tr3RE4R)
