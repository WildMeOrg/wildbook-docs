# Roadmap
The roadmaps below are rough outlines of our objectives. We operate by milestones, and sometimes things change dramatically because of technical limitations or pressing issues reported by users.

## Wildbook
We are working on a improve-and-refresh objective. We want to improve on the user experience of Wildbook platform users with each release while also making the technology more accessible to the development community and indepedent installers. As such, we trade off a major feature release with a timeboxed tech debt release. We plan to continue this cadence through the end of 2024.

### 10.6.0
Feature focused release.
* All objects indexing in open search
* All filters available for all search formats
* Manual annotation and rotation

### 10.7.0
Tech debt release.
* Decouple WBIA
* Generated API documentation
* Weblate setup

### 10.8.0
Feature focused release.
* Custom fields support and data migration

### And Beyond
This work is planned for development, but is not set for an immediate release. Note that this list does not include minor changes and updates, some of which may be done iteratively.

* Bulk Import transition
* Permissions: staff role, collaboration and projects impact, org access
* Data integrity tools
* Projects
